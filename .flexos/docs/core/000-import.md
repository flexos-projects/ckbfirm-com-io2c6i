# Project Origin

> Resurrection of The CKB Firm website, transitioning from a legacy CMS to a modern Astro architecture.

## Source Metadata

- **Source URL:** `https://ckbfirm.com`
- **Type:** `website_scrape`
- **Pages Crawled:** 9
- **Date Scanned:** October 2023

## Key Insights & Status

1.  **Content Quality:** The original content is rated as "Fair." It conveys authority but lacks depth in specific practice areas. The salvageable content highlights the firm's focus on "law office automation" and "quality relationships."
2.  **SEO Structure:** The legacy site relied on query-based URLs (e.g., `?page_id=11`), which hurt search rankings. The new site must implement clean, keyword-rich slugs.
3.  **Visual Identity:** The original site used a generic blue (`#21759B`) and standard fonts (Arial). The redesign elevates this to a "Modern Professional" aesthetic using a deeper Navy (`#1B365D`) and Gold (`#C5A059`) palette to reflect authority.
4.  **Missing Critical Pages:** The scrape identified gaps: no dedicated Blog/Insights section, no detailed Case Results, and no Privacy Policy.

## Strategic Decisions

- **Migration Strategy:** Content will be migrated from the unstructured legacy pages into structured Markdown/MDX content collections.
- **Tech Upgrade:** Moving from a slow, dynamic CMS to a static, high-performance Astro 5 build to improve PageSpeed Insights scores.
- **Brand Refresh:** Retaining the core mission of "automation + legal expertise" while updating the visual language to appeal to institutional clients like banks and manufacturers.
